Standard Notes Web Interface's Image for Docker
===============================================

Unfortunately, the core developer of [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/)
doesn't maintain Docker images for the different components of his web service
(which can be [self-hosted](https://docs.standardnotes.org/self-hosting/self-hosting-with-docker)).

This project is aimed to fill the gap, by providing a Docker image for the
[Sandard Notes web interface](https://github.com/standardnotes/web).

Used by and made for [Klo√ºgle](https://github.com/arugifa/klougle), the Google
alternative automated with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
